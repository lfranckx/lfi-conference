                        This is not some kind of immutable law of engineering, it’s the direct consequence of specific choices people commonly make...and you can make different ones. What we call “debugging” is often just pattern matching on past experiences, which means you get good at debugging by experiencing similar incidents over and over and over. 
                        But what if you stop getting a ton of repeat outages? What if, whenever you get paged, it’s almost always something new? Time to systems; how to methodically interrogate your systems, putting one foot after the other by asking question after question, which is how you follow the results to the answer. Every time. 
                        Teams that are consistently good at debugging weren’t born that way; they got good by 1) using good tools, and 2) learning to leverage and piggyback off each other’s expertise.</p>

                    <p class="description">After burning out as an Architect, learning about Learning from Incidents revitalised my enthusiasm for working in complex systems and prevented me from choosing life as a peasant farmer. It has deeply changed how I approach my work as an SRE Principal Engineer. Incidents are a key source of insight into the strengths and constraints in socio-technical systems but those direct insights are just the beginning. The tools, mindset and concepts that form the foundation of modern LFI practices have much wider applicability. </p>
                    <p class="description">In this talk I’ll share how I came to incident learning and how, over the last 4 years, the theory and practice of LFI and Resilience Engineering have fundamentally changed where and how I seek to influence systemic change and improve site operations. Beyond the incidents, I’ll share examples relating to policy refinement, tool design, team structure, measures for reporting, and making space by being a visible advocate for people working at the sharp end. </p>
                    <p class="description">My journey has had many overlapping stages. My initial focus was on enhancing the expertise and judgement of engineers. That developed to include understanding the trade-space engineers work within. Later still I came to appreciate the value of identifying patterns of decisions and their consequences sometimes spanning years. I now try to use those patterns to inform higher level decisions that change the options available to engineers.</p>

It can be hard to get out of our comfort zones and engage in what might seem like a game. It's worth examining those roadblocks and learning new techniques to unlock the benefits of "Dungeons and Dragons for engineers".</p>
                    <p class="description">Disaster roleplaying comes in many forms, and different approaches will be appropriate for teams and individuals at different times. We'll start by examining some of those approaches and how we can fit them in with our existing team activities.</p>
                    <p class="description">No matter your approach, however, a poorly-developed or non-engaging scenario can be a recipe for boredom, or even the gradual dissolution of our rugged band of incident adventurers. We'll look at some good, and not-so-good, scenario examples, both to learn to evaluate them and to build them efficiently.</p>
                    <p class="description">Even the most well-developed scenario can't solve, by itself, for every individuals' needs when engaging in a disaster roleplaying exercise. We want to ensure our exercises are inclusive and allow participation for as many learning types as possible. We'll examine some common inclusivity pitfalls and some creative ways to engage our entire teams.</p>
                    <p class="description">Finally, we'll bring it all together with an example exercise and identify some critical things a good "dungeon master" must do to ensure a successful experience for all. We'll leave with a few immediate things we can do to build a good incidents culture, even before we're ready to fully embrace disaster roleplaying. Wizard hats optional, but encouraged!</p>

                    <p class="description">This talk will discuss the differences among reactive, responsive, and proactive approaches to safety and performance monitoring. In many safety critical domains, monitoring of the process being managed is a core function to ensuring safe operations. While monitoring in the software engineering domain typically looks at technical performance of the system, in this context we include the socio-technical system, that is, monitoring the work being done and monitoring the system's ability to deliver work.</p>
                    <p class="description">The monitoring capability of a proactive management system must be informed by at least three types of monitoring (Balkin, 2023). Firstly, capability must exist to monitor for changes in the system, which goes beyond monitoring technical performance to include, through reflective system analysis, monitoring for the violation of requirements and assumptions made during system design. Secondly, the socio-technical system must monitor the ability of the system to detect, interpret, and communicate changes to decision-making agents, which includes continuous confirmatory testing that the sampling process would in fact collect and distribute desired and useful information regarding changes to the appropriate parts of the system. Thirdly, monitoring system adaptive capacity, which Woods & Rayo (2022, p. 16) define as “the potential for adjusting patterns of activities to handle future changes in the kinds of events, opportunities and disruptions experienced." Finally, forecasting the system’s ability to respond to the types, frequency, and severity of changes and challenges detected by the monitoring system would require an additional meta-monitoring capability to detect and sensemake patterns of how adaptive capacity is created, preserved, and degraded.</p>
                    <p class="description">The talk draws on the existing literature base, as well as my ongoing research in the domains of healthcare, aviation, and defense acquisitions. In it, we will explore requirements and design considerations for proactive performance monitoring programs as well as various monitoring indicators to support a proactive approach, to help inform the field of software engineering.</p>

                    <p class="description">The IBM CIO organization is making significant progress along our journey to learn from our incidents. Where previously a small number of our leaders would discuss a handful of "major incident" RCAs focusing almost exclusively what broke and how we’re fixing it, we are now having broad and open discussions that are improving everyone's understanding of our systems, the expertise that keeps them running normally, and the challenges that can overwhelm that expertise.    </p>
                    <p class="description">A centerpiece of the CIO Learning from Incidents Program is a monthly meeting in which CIO executives, our most senior technical leaders, and many others gather to review and discuss the story of one recent incident. Hundreds of CIO team members have participated in these meetings and/or viewed the recordings, and these monthly meetings have led to several significant outcomes. CIO leaders now frequently ask that surprises within their organizations be included in the monthly meeting series.  These monthly meetings are also inspiring CIO teams to improve their own practice of learning from incidents.  </p>
                    <p class="description">In this presentation, we’ll share how we prepare for and run these meetings, and  outcomes we’ve observed, and how we are leveraging these meetings to scale adoption of LFI throughout the organization.</p>

You toss and turn vehemently as your mind races from nightmare to nightmare. RPS is rapidly plummeting during Black Friday…oh my gosh logs are truncated and pods are expiring…can’t deserialize customer orders from Kafka…why don’t we have observability here?…oh no this runbook is out of date…why is <10x engineer> OOO right now, who do I page??? You rocket up in a frenzied state, hair tousled, muscles tensed, and heart rate a few clicks below maximum. We need to be better prepared, you reconcile to soothe your panicked mind, we need the lessons learned from an incident post-mortem, but before the bad things happen…almost like a pre-incident-post-mortem…a pre-mortem!</p>
                    <p class="description">At Stripe, we’ve learned a tremendous amount from post incident-activities, and increased the priority of all sorts of work based on that insight. However, we eventually asked ourselves, why wait for the bad thing to happen to have these conversations?</p>
                    <p class="description">Recently, we developed a set of pre-mortem exercises that teams at Stripe can use to preemptively cover their bases in preparation for big events. We’ve used this template on our API Platform team to catch and patch observability edge cases, envision potential responses (and shortcomings) in disaster scenarios, and test and clean up our runbooks in preparation for our biggest days of the year, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
                    <p class="description">In this talk we review our approach. Join us as we take a deep-dive into the incident response zeitgeist at Stripe and how we can all contribute together to more reliable distributed software systems.</p>

Included in these triggering factors are things such as a long-forgotten mailing list and a yearly camel festival in India.
                        These sorts of incidents can easily be relegated to "black swan" status, but this talk will challenge the audience to think about what their versions of these incidents might look like. Throughout, we will consider what we all could learn from these sorts of incidents instead of shrugging our shoulders and saying "This will probably never happen again."</p>

                    <p class="description">Enova International is a leading financial technology company in a highly regulated industry. We started conducting production incidents and documenting them as early as 2012. What started originally as just written documents on our company wiki grew to a full fledged practice of running incidents followed by post-mortems (or as we like to call them, “post-incident retrospectives”), which includes analyzing and learning as much as possible from each one of them.</p>
                    <p class="description">In this  talk, I’ll share the history of Incident Management & Analysis at Enova including: how learning from incidents helped Enova shift from a traditional support organization to embracing DevOps and SRE cultures, how we adopted new technologies and built resilient services while continuing to ensure service to our customers, how we moved away from metrics that target less incidents, to a culture that empowers engineers to make incidents visible in order to embrace the learning that comes out of it, and how the entire organization makes use of opportunities that arise from incidents.</p>
                    <p class="description">I’ll also talk about how having more than just the technology organization as part of incidents helped us adopt a culture of learning and improving across all aspects of our business and technology.</p>
                    <p class="description">I’ll provide some cases of incidents that resulted in both short term and long term actions that led to improvements across products and technology.</p>
                    <p class="description">Through this talk, I hope people will be able to learn how focusing on learning from incidents can help change cultures in an organization.</p>

Such handover communication is for example crucial in health care institutions, in nuclear power and in software operations. Handover communications in software operations happen on a daily basis much like in health care. </p>
                    <p class="description">Examples of handover communications in software operations include verbal or digital written handover communications that occur during shift changes or on-call within a network operations center or customer support center. Handover communications can occur during high tempo and high-stake scenarios or low tempo and low-stake scenarios and having confidence in the information and it being understood is important. </p>

                    <p class="description">Despite the importance of handover communications in software operations, the research into increased or decreased confidence of the engineer to understand the current state of the system after the information exchange is scarce.</p>

                    <p class="description">When “a big one” happens that affects multiple teams and customers you’ve got a captive audience and platform to talk about the people, processes, and technology involved in your organization.   That is exactly what I did.</p>
                    <p class="description">Examining each step of the journey from PR to production deploy I uncovered the technical snafu that had occurred (surprise, surprise it relates to overwriting key blocks on nested YAML files). My curiosity pushed me further to study the life of a request from our CDN to a given Kubernetes Pod and I felt more comfortable debugging ingress and traffic issues afterwards.</p>
                    <p class="description">Leaning into the spirit of learning from incidents I crafted a delightful post-incident review featuring descriptive charts with links to dashboards and a breakdown of the incident and key moments. After sharing that document far and wide I joined an internal group for our backend developers and broke down the life of a request and answered questions about our set-up.  In the end the most valuable investment I made was in sharing the failures and learnings across team and department boundaries, stoking the curiosity of our developers, making “the ops stuff” approachable and friendly and honestly not having shame about being “the human cause” of error.  By sharing this tale I hope that every attendee finds a takeaway or practice they can tuck in their pocket for the future.</p>

Each world has unique attributes, tooling, and contexts, yet general patterns emerge from the diversity. Richard Cook and I first met 34 years ago discussing patterns in cognitive work revealed by an adverse event in the operating room. Richard saw the case as another example of my previous pattern finding results across other settings.

                    <p class="description">On the morning of Saturday, August 31st, 2019, one of the data center facilities in Amazon's us-east-1 region lost power and its backup generators failed. During this outage, Vanguard lost several EC2 instances in our AWS environment. However, there were no major client-impacting incidents resulting from the loss of these EC2s. In this presentation, we'll explore how our robust architectures made this possible, and how we subsequently used this event as an opportunity to explore our "near misses" in depth. We applied the post-incident review technique to an event where no incident response was necessary, capturing critical success stories that bolstered the business case for continued investment in technology modernization and cloud migration.</p>
                    <p class="description">This presentation is adapted from the attached internal blog post that was published in 2019 shortly after the AWS incident, summarizing our learnings. The presentation will include additional commentary on the nature of near misses.</p>

Learn why chat bots are the future of incident response and you should be thinking about how to get started if you aren't yet using one. We'll cover how you can drive adoption of a bot within your team to streamline workflows and response during times of stress. Not only will we discuss the technology and culture of using a bot for incident management, we will also cover how to derive metrics and analytics about incidents, and how you can integrate that data into larger analyses tied to your team's impact on the business.</p>

                    <p class="description">As a former EMT who has worked on ambulances in situations from motorcycle race in the middle of nowhere desert to the middle of the Las Vegas strip, I'm constantly amazed at the number of people who say they can't adopt an incident response framework, certainly not an ICS based one. They just don't have the number of people.</p>
                    <p class="description">When asked they usually tell me the oh, only have 5, 10, 15 or even 20 engineers!</p>
                    <p class="description">While ICS does have it's faults, it has also enabled a more cohesive framework for responders of various types to respond to incidents of almost any size. This framework also underlies many of the response processes in software today.</p>
                    <p class="description">Once developed, this shared knowledge and skillset can help create more resilient teams that are better prepared to learn from incidents.</p>
                    <p class="description">I'll outline what my experience, managing physical emergencies in an ambulance and ER, taught me about responding to incidents starting with a small team and how it can be grown and scaled up and perhaps more importantly scaled back down.</p>
                    <p class="description">I'll go over how to apply the principles of ICS to your team if you don't already have a framework, and how to improve the scaling steps if you already have a framework for your team. Unless you're doing incident response perfectly (trust me, none of us are), chances are there is something you'll be able to take away, whether you're still asking yourself "I just got paged, now what?" or if you know the finer points of ICS-400.</p>

That's everything from dozens of AWS services, to payment APIs, chat integrations, and CI/CD tools, just to name a few. We don't control these cloud dependencies, but they are often critical components of our services and user experiences. How we manage these building blocks of modern software impacts our ability to respond to and learn from incidents.  I'd love to facilitate a discussion in an intentional hallway track around how incident responders are impacted by the reality described above. - How do third-party cloud dependencies impact our ability to run reliable services, if at all? - Is there anything we can actually do when a cloud dependency outage happens? - Are there reasonable ways to avoid the impact of cloud dependency outages? - How we can learn from the past to: reduce the risk from third-party cloud dependencies?</p>

Incidents are about surprise: seeing and learning what we didn’t expect. What do we do instead? In this session, you’ll hear about 0 frameworks and at least 3 patterns we first discovered and now amplify. Sometimes we can give people tools over structure; power over constraint.</p>

                    <p class="description">Clint Byrum had an incident retro hijacked by blame. He will share that story. As a way to start the conversation, Eric will speculate about how his aikido experience might show up if that were to happen to him. Let’s prepare at least a little for potential worst case scenarios in incident facilitation.</p>

Ever present and slow to share, we’ve all encountered at least one incident where someone deep in the company “just had to know” about a specific piece of a system to put out a fire. This is the worst place to be — siloed and reliant on heroism to resolve incidents — and yet, it seems we all find ourselves here inevitably. But what if we told you it didn’t have to be this way? That with the appropriate time and investment, you could level-up your engineers faster, break down your knowledge silos, and lower your cholesterol.</p>
                    <p class="description">In this talk, we will share the things we’ve implemented on Stripe’s API Platform team to quickly get new folks ready for our on-call rotation. We will provide actionable examples, broken down into three types of changes we’ve made: documentation, process, and observability. We will discuss things like low-effort gamedays, utilizing incident reports for learning, and our approach to shadow on-call rotations.   A heart-healthy on-call rotation means reducing engineer burnout, increasing the ability to trust and rely on your coworkers, and quickly mitigating incidents in a blameless way. Join us for a deep-dive of Stripe’s approach to continuously improving on-call.</p>

                    <p class="description">We begin in the shallow end, where the waves are calm and the familiar sand warms our toes: can duration tell us anything about our incidents? We test the waters and feel we could linger here a while, but it’s somehow…unsatisfying. We wade a bit deeper, gaining comfort and confidence. Could other things tell us more, severity perhaps? No, it floats away, providing no guidance.</p>
                    <p class="description">We drift out with the tide and now our toes barely skim the bottom—we're beginning to tread water. Looking out farther, we realize the water becomes murky, the details hard to discern. There’s a distinct draw to dive down, where we uncover a whole universe we didn’t realize existed. Coordinated schools of vibrantly-colored fish dart by, weaving through intricate mazes of plants and coral, and in the darkest depths lurk surprising and unexpected dangers.</p>
                    <p class="description">It’s here, in the deep end of incidents, that yields the most value if we’re willing to dive in. In this talk, I’ll show how the shallow data of incidents reveal little, and give examples of incident reports from the VOID (Verica Open Incident Database) that illustrate the value of substantive, qualitative investigation. I examine how this hard work benefits others, our collective messages in bottles feeding back into a safer and more navigable sea for everyone.</p>

                    <p class="description">Digital outages are inevitable in complex production software systems and can have dangerous effects for mission-critical IT infrastructure like those found in the Department of Defense (DoD) environments. Our Resilience Engineering Ops Simulation (OREOS) revealed challenges to our digital services such as multi-adversarial attacks, coordinated team responses, and highly sensitive information concerns. The aim of this talk is to describe the staged world process, difficulty in capturing the real world, and specific obstacles discovered when dealing with the DoD as a customer similar to other security incidents in the larger business-critical digital services industry.</p>
                    <p class="description">Teams scramble to troubleshoot and respond to outages, which continually challenge their current mental models of the system. Diverse perspectives are needed in adapting to disruptions, particularly in coping with the challenges deploying to distributed DoD environments. While these multiple perspectives are necessary, they can also create conflicts in responsibility, authority, and goals within and across echelons.  We brought together diverse software teams to elicit their experiences in working with DoD deployments through low-fidelity staged world simulations. Staged world problems are similar to game days in that they are high fidelity example problems that prompt a wide range of stories that can broaden and narrow the range of responses, including hard problems like overcoming opaque tools and limited access to distributed systems. The staged world is used as a means to uncover the challenges, because of the difficulty in simulating the true operational setting. Running teams through these experiences culminated in a deep understanding for the organization of the various problems our teams have faced and new pathways to explore in anticipating and supporting their adaptive capacity to maneuver within the DoD ecosystem.</p>

                    <p class="description">LFI community discussions often focus on the principles and activities involved in the investigation process, such as interviews and group review meetings.  These are undoubtedly critical steps toward producing write-ups that are worth reading and review meetings worth attending.  But is it sufficient to produce high-quality write-ups and to share these in well-attended and engaging review meetings? </p>
                    <p class="description">An important goal of LFI is to create a culture where people actively read the incident write-ups that others have produced. These may be people who joined the organization long after the write-up was  published and the review meeting occurred. Or they may be people who were simply too busy to fully engage at the time.  Once an organization has adopted LFI, there can eventually be many write-ups, and the need for some kind of library.</p>
                    <p class="description">So let’s assume that we now have a collection of high-quality write-ups. Perhaps we also have recordings of some of those awesome review meetings. What are the next steps toward creating a library out of these resources, and (most importantly) helping people to use this library?</p>
                    <p class="description">This will be a facilitated, interactive, discussion with other aspiring “incident librarians” about topics such as:</p>

                        <li>Engagement: How to encourage questions and comments on the write-ups?</li>
                        <li>Curation: How to maintain the quality of the library’s content?</li>

Data gathered during the analysis, after the incident, can only get you so far. Data gathered during the incident, during the response to the incident, can give you a much richer view of what happened, and how. Your incident analysis should include an examination of how you responded to the incident. What worked well and what didn't about the response? How could you be better prepared for the next response?</p>

Effective language can lead to individual and organizational learning during pre-mission briefings, real-time activities, and post-mission analysis. However, the meaning of language is not constant - it changes based on the experience of the person, the context of the event, and the social construction of the communicators.</p>
                    <p class="description">The language we use in accident investigations can impact how we make sense of events and whether we learn from them. Many factors can influence incident investigators during the collection of information and the writing of the report, such as our need for certainty in our lives, our inclination to assign agency, and our inherent biases. Incident reports often contain language that influences readers to make judgments that lead to simplistic blame, scapegoating, or even moral condemnation. Indeed, 'facts' are nothing without context, yet investigation language often closes the door to this rich world of information through its agentive descriptions, causal attributions, and use of taxonomies that place actions and decisions into predetermined 'boxes'.</p>

                    <p class="description">The Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) is a method for studying complex systems, including sociotechnical systems. Outcome agnostic, it models these systems in terms of their functions, dependencies, and interactions - identifying variance in function outputs (which can be good too!) instead of a "success/failure" paradigm. This approach allows for a better understanding of how systems work and - importantly - how they interact. </p>
                    <p class="description">FRAM is not a replacement for any existing LFI processes, but rather another valuable tool that is applicable to retrospective analysis (incidents) as well as prospective analysis of system dynamics. It helps analysts and SMEs to think deeply about their systems, interactions, dependencies, and expectations in both normal work (!) and unusual circumstances.  Importantly, it also generates compelling visual artifacts that can be a powerful tool in narrative building and knowledge elicitation/sharing.</p>
                    <p class="description">While one can go quite deep into the technicalities of FRAM, a conference session covering the basics should be sufficient to develop a foundational understanding, model literacy, and an eye for where the method may or may not be worth the investment when learning from incidents.</p>
                    <p class="description">Learning from incidents involves tradeoffs. It is, after all, cognitive work. There is a case to be made for FRAM, as a supplementary method to existing LFI processes, deserving consideration when deciding what deliberate efforts to put into learning about a system/from an incident.</p>

                    <p class="description">Much like when a software company blames engineers for their service outages, the US Forest Service had a history of blaming the dead after accidents. This resulted in a crisis of trust that was undermining communications and information flow. The result was an abysmal accident rate and a breakdown of the relationship between front-line workers and leadership. </p>
                    <p class="description">This talk will explore field initiatives and leadership actions that began to change the organization's approach to learning. Three key pillars will be introduced: The leadership safety journey, field initiatives that worked directly with practitioners to change the way the organization responded to accidents and incidents, and some of the research that underpinned the changes that took place.</p>

                    <p class="description">'For how much the world relies on software, it's a wonder anything gets done.'</p>
                    <p class="description">This is the starting premise for those who study Resilience Engineering, and who put it into practice with the goal of producing reliable or safe software systems. Success isn't to be taken for grant in these circles. It must be produced and reproduced on a regular basis and under modulating conditions, which sometimes requires handling major surprises and ends up with incomprehensible results. Yet somehow things often still manage to work out alright. Getting those results requires the complex interplay of social and technical skills.</p>
                    <p class="description">That description, however, is too simple. It doesn't adequately account for the wrinkles which women and others with non-majority identities navigate and which is integral to the work. In fact, it quietly assumes a faux-neutrality and seems to make aspects like gender marginal to the whole process.</p>
                    <p class="description">This panel discussion will attempt to correct for that marginalization. Practitioners will discuss their experiences performing resilience with people in socio-technical systems as "care work," criss-crossing between the time scales of immediate incident response and longer-term 'glue work' that creates the conditions for those responses. The participants will emphasize how the dimensions of intersecting identities factors into the relationships between people, the practices of software development and operations, their organizations, and the broader states of affairs.</p>

                    <p class="description">What does it look like when an organization makes real progress when it comes to learning from incidents? </p>
                    <p class="description">It is clear that an absence (or decrease) of incidents is not evidence that learning is happening effectively. The presence (or increase) of incidents is not proof that learning from them is poor, either.</p>
                    <p class="description">So what does “good” look like? My colleagues and I have worked over the past five years with a wide range of organizations. Companies of all shapes and sizes — some public, some private. Some distributed all across the globe, some very centralized.</p>
                    <p class="description">In this talk we will describe results of a multi-year longitudinal study with an exemplar client of ours. We explored what signals, markers, and indicators that actual learning was taking place. Our findings were (and continue to be) remarkable. The work done by their relatively small — but incredibly skilled — group of incident analysts has created and sustained conditions that make it possible for people all across their organization to learn in meaningful ways.</p>
